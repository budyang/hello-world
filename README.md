# hello-world

Greetings!

I'm a techno savvy.
I love to know about everything regarding science and technology.
I want to know how these technological advances work.
Of course, I'd love to share these to you.

My expertise are on Java, .net, and .esp.
I'm currently in the middle of educating myself on PHP and syntax.
